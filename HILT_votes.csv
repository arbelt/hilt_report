7,"With the advent of MOOCs (massive open on-line course) such as those offered by EdX, what would be the best way to leverage these large communities of students to inform and drive teaching methods? Example: It may be possible to implement semi-randomized studies of teaching methods which are not adverse to students (maintain 'fairness' in grading) but which would not only be able to which teaching methods perform better than others (e.g., short teaching section immediately followed by short problem vs. long, in-depth teaching section followed by longer exercises at a later date) but also to develop mechanisms to differentiate between which methods are best suited for which students. This may be important since it seem likely that some students will be better helped by one method while others by another, and it may be possible to create a more personal or individually optimized learning experience at relatively low per-student cost. - 132d418bd5a4de28b4e5357613b5ad8857b5480139613e9f2b8e5636"
